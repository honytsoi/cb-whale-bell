# CB Whale Bell üêã

A client-side web application for Chaturbate broadcasters to track and monitor high-value tippers ("whales") and other key user activity. Safely store and analyze your tipping history and real-time events without sharing sensitive data with third parties.

## Features

-   **100% Client-Side & Secure**: All data processing and storage happens *only* in your browser. Your data never leaves your device.
-   **Tiered Data Storage**: Efficiently stores lifetime spending aggregates (total tips, privates, etc.) for all users in one IndexedDB store, while keeping detailed event history (tips, entries, follows, etc.) only for a configurable recent period (default 30 days) in another store to save space and improve performance.
-   **Performance Optimized**: Refactored data handling (utilizing IndexedDB and tiered storage) to efficiently manage large tipping histories and event volumes.
-   **Whale Detection**: Identify users who meet your personalized whale criteria based on lifetime totals and recent activity.
-   **Real-Time Alerts**: Get instant audible notifications and visible highlights in the activity log when users meeting your whale criteria enter your room.
-   **Track Follow Events**: See when users follow your channel directly in the real-time activity log.
-   **Detailed Activity Log**: View recent user entries, follows, tips, media purchases, and more with clear timestamps and event types.
-   **Automatic Threshold Suggestions**: Analyze your imported history data to recommend personalized whale criteria settings.
-   **Data Export/Import (v2.1 Format)**: Backup and restore your complete dataset (lifetime aggregates, recent events, and settings) in a secure JSON format. Optional password encryption is available for exports.
    -   **Important:** Importing data will **REPLACE** all existing data (users, recent events, settings) in the application. Merging data is currently disabled in v2.1.
-   **Cross-Browser Compatible**: Works on most modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari - latest versions recommended). Utilizes the Web Audio API for alert sounds.

4.  **Step 2: Import History (Optional)**
    *   If you want to include past data for lifetime totals and threshold suggestions, import your token history CSV file. [Guide](https://www.adult-webcam-faq.com/guide/exporting-chaturbate-data/) on exporting your history.
5.  **Step 3: Set Whale Thresholds**
    *   Configure the token amounts for your whale criteria (Lifetime Spending, Recent Tips, etc.).

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

-   Modern web browser
-   Local web server (e.g., Python's `http.server`, VS Code Live Server extension, Nginx, Apache) to properly handle modules and other features. Opening `index.html` directly via `file://` URL might not work as expected due to browser security restrictions on local files.

### Running Locally

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/honytsoi/cb-whale-bell.git
    cd cb-whale-bell
    ```

2.  Serve the directory using a local web server. For example, with Python:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the address/port your server uses).

No complex build process or external dependencies required locally - it's plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! External libraries (jsQR, PapaParse, CryptoJS, Dexie) are loaded via CDN links in `index.html`.

## Data Privacy

-   All data processing and logic runs entirely within your web browser.
-   No data is ever sent to any server, including the developer's.
-   **Aggregate user data** (lifetime totals, first/last seen dates) and **recent detailed events** (e.g., last 30 days, configurable) are stored persistently in your browser's IndexedDB database.
-   Older detailed events are automatically pruned from the IndexedDB based on your "Recent Event Retention" setting to manage browser storage space and maintain performance.
-   You can clear *all* stored data (users, events, settings) anytime through the settings panel ("Factory Reset").
-   You can export your data backup anytime, with an optional password encryption layer for added security.

## Browser Support

-   Most modern browsers are supported. Tested primarily on:
    -   Chrome (latest)
    -   Edge (latest)
-   Likely compatible with recent versions of Firefox and Safari, though minor UI variations may occur.
